Business Calculator V.1.0.0
For the past few weeks I have been dedicating my time to creating a scalable software which can compute all business calculations in a few clicks.
Everyday, small and medium businesses face challenges with figures and balancing sheets while dedicating their time in creating value.
Unfortunately, most of these businesses are unable to strike a balance this inturn leads to loss and in the worst case "failure".
This software helps reduce the time it takes for small and medium businesses to solve these challenges and focuses on creating a better value system for their customers.
This first version release for the application  primarily contains four most common business mathematical problems. (Business gain calculations, Minimum retail price,Tax return, Fiscal year Net return).
Subsequently, the application is built with a scalable technology (REACT JS, ECMASCRIPT 2016) which allows subsequent release of new features at a very fast pace in a component specific approach.
This means that in the long run, all possible business calculation functions will be written and deployed as new versions are released.
In order to make this aforementioned more scalable, I will be making â€œbusiness calculator" an open source software where developers across the globe can contribute to the project.
In the next beta version, There will be API support for the software for all platforms.
Please you can forward your feedback to this email.
