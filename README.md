Business Calcutor V.1.0.0
For the past few weeks I have been dedicating my time in creating a scalable software which can compute all business calculations with a few clicks.
Everyday, small and meduim businesses face challenges with numbers and in making sure the sheet is balance and also dedicating their time in creating value. Not being able to strike a balance for these businesses leads to lose and in the worst case "failure".
I hope the software will reduce the time it’s takes for small and meduim businesses in solving this challenges and focus on creating a better value system for their customers.
This is the first version release for the application, and contain primarily four most common business mathematical problems.( business gain calculations, Minimum retail price, tax return, fiscal year Net return).
However the application is built with a scalable technology (REACT JS, ECMASCRIPT 2016), which allow subsequent release of new features at a very fast pace, in a component specific approach.
This means that in the long run all possible business calculations function will be written and deployed as new version are released.
In other to make this aforementioned more scalable , I will be making “business calculator  “ an open source software, where developers across the globe can contribute to the project.
In the next beta version, There will be API support for the software for all platforms.
Please you can forward your feedback to this email.
